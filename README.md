## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content

- Also, my personal challenge here is to practice with the basics of **React**.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I have practiced with React components and basics about the structure of this Framework. 


### Continued development

The aim of this solution is to start a series of challenges to improve my React knowledge. So, if there is something to especially focus on in this project, it is the React coding.
